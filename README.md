Simple task tracker to learn myself some concepts

- [x] Basic setup
- [x] Learn about project layout
- [x] Learn about component splits
- [x] Gain insight into why single-file components are a better separation of concerns for webdev than splitting by language.
- [x] Awesome. We have scoped styling!
- [x] Get distracted. Stop pomodoro timer. Restart pomodoro timer. Start learning again.
- [x] Yada yada, arrays, loops in a v-for, data bound in main app if we don't use a statemanager.
- [x] Alright, $emit is how we pass events around like we're 2015 AngularJS
- [ ] How do we $emit to a specific place? E.g. component -> parent -> grandchild
- [ ] Can we broadcast events to all components?
- [ ] How does routing work?
- [ ] How can we handle more complex state management?
- [ ] What part of the HTML can we render out beforehand?
- [ ] How does the app tie into SEO requirements for annotated data?
